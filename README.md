The FileUtility Java program is a simple command-line application designed to help beginners understand basic file operations such as writing, reading, and modifying files using Javaâ€™s standard I/O libraries. The program continuously runs in a loop, offering a menu-driven interface that allows the user to select one of four options: write to a file, read from a file, append content to a file, or exit the program. Upon choosing the write option, the user is prompted to enter the file name and then type lines of text. Input continues until the user types "EOF" on a new line, signaling the end of input. All the input lines are gathered using a StringBuilder and written to the specified file using a FileWriter. This operation overwrites any existing content in the file. If the read option is selected, the program asks for a file name and reads the file line-by-line using a BufferedReader wrapped around a FileReader, displaying the content to the console. This is useful for viewing what is stored in a text file. In the modify operation, the user provides a file name and some text, and the program appends the new content to the end of the file instead of overwriting it. This is done using a FileWriter in append mode by passing true as the second argument in its constructor. After writing, it confirms that the file has been modified successfully. The fourth option simply exits the program by closing the Scanner used for user input and terminating the loop. The program includes three helper methods to keep the logic organized: writeToFile, readFromFile, and modifyFile, each encapsulating the logic for their respective tasks. These methods also include error handling with try-catch blocks to ensure that any IOException (such as file not found or permission denied) is handled gracefully with a simple error message instead of crashing the program. The use of Scanner makes user input intuitive, while FileWriter and BufferedReader simplify file interactions. This program is structured in a way that introduces beginners to important programming concepts like input/output handling, exception management, loops, conditionals, and modular code design. It demonstrates how text files can be used for simple data storage and retrieval in Java. It also serves as a foundation for building more advanced file-based applications like notepads, loggers, or basic text editors. The code is easy to read, with clear method names and logical flow, making it ideal for learning and experimenting. By modifying or extending this program, beginners can gain confidence in Java and develop an understanding of how applications interact with the file system. Overall, the FileUtility program is a practical and educational example of how to implement basic file operations in Java using clean and maintainable code.
